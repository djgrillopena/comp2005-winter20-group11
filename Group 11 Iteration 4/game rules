So the game rules are pretty similar to the ones which you guys gave us.
But we made some changes to make the game short.
The rule is that whoever wins the first 2 chips wins the game.
We can easily make that number bigger to make the game intresting. But right now we kept in mind that you have to check if the game is running or not so we kept it short.
Once any player has 2 target chips then the game is over and winner player is declared.
About the timer. We just gave 1 minute so that you could check. That 1 minute can be easily changed to a larger time to amke the game more fun.
And to know how to play just watch our short video so that you understand how to play, bid and move the tokens.

Thanks.
