hey!
So just run the RichochetRobots.jar (This file is also inside the game. So if the outside does not work then just download from inside.)
(double click on the jar file.)
The game is ready and working. 
We covered the colourdefficiency bonus question by providig the name of the target places and token names such as Blue,Red,Green etc.
Also we were very close to finishing the load game but did not go through.
Now the game contains everything but just not the complex board. We knew the logic how to apply but could not built due to short time. 
Other than that the game is perfect. 
The option button and load button on the front are just buttons with no actionlistner(sorry about that)
Also we uploaded a short video that has a winning senario. Any how, there can be many events. we have kept in mind every possible event.
Please read the game rules which is in other text file.
Thanks
Stay safe and healthy.
