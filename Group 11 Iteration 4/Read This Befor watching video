Hey So even in video there were certain thing that it did not recorded. 
So when you click on the player1 player2 then it would ask you to bid the number
So on my screen the bid was asked but when i watched the video it did not cover it for some reason. 
So i am extremly sorry fpr that but you can play tha game and see it for yourself thate game is perfect and running.
If you do not get how to play then just email Kathan. at kjshah@mun.ca I would email you back ASAP and let you know how that works.
once again sorry,
Thanks
